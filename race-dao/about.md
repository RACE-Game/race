### What is RACE DAO?

RACE DAO is a protocol DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) with a single mission:&#x20;

> To empower developers, players, and investors by providing a revolutionary decentralized gaming platform that harnesses the power of blockchain technology. We believe in a future where gaming is inclusive, accessible, and fueled by the passion and creativity of our global community.

DAOs are the future of organizations and collectives. We have no doubts in our minds about this, and is one of the reasons we decided to organize RACE Protocol around a DAO structure. Even though DAOs are still early on the foundational concepts, they have already proven to be a powerful evolution over centralized company planning and execution.

As a **protocol DAO**, our philosophy is **product quality** and **community first**. Projects and people from across the GameFi space can come together to collaborate and vote to build the best products for the future of gaming. Being a DAO means builders, investors, and users all have an aligned economic incentive to move us forward fast while benefiting all parties fairly.



**RACE DAO** is an organization with leadership and structure, and the best way to think about being a part of it and how it compares with a traditional company rests in the following benefits:

1. Any RACE token holder from across the world can exercise their DAO membership with **voting rights** that can alter the future of the organization.  &#x20;
2. RACE holders that stake and lock their governance tokens can enjoy **revenue sharing** from the organization as distributions.&#x20;
3. Any person can become a valuable contributor to a DAO working group and **earn compensation** from the organization treasury for their contributions
