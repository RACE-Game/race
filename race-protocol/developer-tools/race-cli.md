# ðŸ’» RACE CLI

The `race-cli` is a powerful command-line tool for developers and node operators to interact with the RACE Protocol. It allows you to manage on-chain assets like game accounts, game bundles, and registration centers directly from your terminal.

***

## **Usage**

The CLI is structured with global options followed by a subcommand and its specific arguments.

**Syntax:**

```sh
# Using the Just command from the project root
just cli -- [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND> [ARGS]

# Or running directly with Cargo
cargo run -p race-cli -- [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND> [ARGS]
```

**Global Options**

These options must be provided before the subcommand.

* `-c`, `--chain <CHAIN>`: **(Required)** The blockchain to interact with. Valid options are solana, sui, and facade.
* `-r`, `--rpc <RPC>`: **(Required)** The RPC endpoint for the specified chain. For convenience, you can use shortcuts for Solana networks: `mainnet` (or `m`), `testnet` (or `t`), `devnet` (or `d`), or `local` (or `l`).
* `-k`, `--keyfile <KEYFILE>`: (Optional) The file path to your wallet keypair. If you use "default", the CLI will use the default keyfile location for the specified chain (e.g., `~/.config/solana/id.json` for Solana).
* `-a`, `--arweave-keyfile <ARWEAVE_KEYFILE>`: (Optional) The path to your Arweave JWK keyfile. This is required for commands that upload data to Arweave, such as `publish`.
