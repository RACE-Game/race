# ðŸ“ƒ Smart Contract

The Race Protocol smart contracts are the on-chain backbone of the ecosystem. They serve as the definitive source of truth for game state, player assets, and ownership, ensuring all interactions are transparent and secure. The protocol's multi-chain design means that while the core concepts are consistent, the specific implementations and instructions are tailored to the unique architectures of each supported blockchain.

This section provides a detailed reference for the instructions available on both the Solana and Sui networks.
