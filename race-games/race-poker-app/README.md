## üÉè **What is RACE Poker?**

RACE Poker is a decentralized on-chain poker platform powered by the [RACE Protocol](broken-reference) and integrated with high-speed Solana blockchain. RACE is not just another online poker site; it is an ecosystem where every shuffle, every bet, and every hand is transparent, secure, and provably fair.

Forget the "black box" servers of traditional online poker. Here, the game logic is [open-sourced](http://github.com/RACE-Game/), public and governed by community and smart contracts ‚Äî self-executing code on the blockchain. This means you never have to blindly trust a central company with your funds or the integrity of the game. You are always in control.

Whether you're a seasoned poker pro looking for a more trustworthy platform or a crypto native ready to test your skills, RACE Poker offers a seamless, fast, and fair playing experience.&#x20;

Get ready to play the game you love, with the security and transparency you deserve.

## ‚ú® **Why Play On-Chain?**

Playing on the blockchain isn't just a gimmick; it's a fundamental upgrade to the online poker experience. Here‚Äôs why playing on RACE Poker gives you an edge you won't find anywhere else:

* **Unmatched Transparency: See Every Move.**\
  Traditional online poker sites operate on private servers, meaning you can't verify the fairness of their card shuffle or game logic. On RACE, the "house" operates in the open. Every single action ‚Äî from the shuffle of the deck to the distribution of the pot ‚Äî is a transaction that is publicly visible, unchangeable and verifiable by anyone at any time.
* **Your Funds, Your Control: Truly Non-Custodial.**\
  On other platforms, your deposits are held by the company. If they go down, your money could go with them. RACE Poker is **non-custodial**. This means we _never_ have access to or control over your funds. Your cryptocurrency stays in your personal wallet, secured by your private key. You deposit directly into the table or tourney account via smart-contract to play and winnings are paid out directly and instantly back to you. **You own your keys, you own your crypto.** It's that simple.
* **A Fair Shuffle, Every Time: Provably Fair Gaming.**\
  Every poker player has wondered if the shuffle is rigged. With RACE Poker, that's a thing of the past. The deck is shuffled and cards are dealt using a [verifiably random cryptographic process](broken-reference). This process is built into the [RACE Protocol](broken-reference) and cannot be manipulated by the platform, the developers, or any single player. The result is a truly random, provably fair game, every single hand.
* **Global Access:** Connect and play from anywhere in the world without the restrictions of traditional banking systems. All you need is a wallet and an internet connection.&#x20;
