# üèóÔ∏è Run Your Label

Move beyond standard online poker and create a fully customized, on-chain poker experience for your own community. This guide is for community leaders, DAO managers, and project founders who want to leverage Racepoker's powerful protocol to **build**, **brand**, and **bank**.

***

### **‚ú® Why Build on RACE Poker?**

Racepoker provides the most transparent, secure, and customizable foundation for community-run poker.

1. **On-Chain Verifiable Fairness**\
   Every shuffle, deal, and outcome is executed by a decentralized smart contract and is fully verifiable on the Solana blockchain. There are no black boxes or hidden server logic. For ultimate decentralization, community members can even run their own open-sourced validator nodes to contribute to the game's randomness.
2. **Community-Owned Architecture**\
   The RACE Poker's ecosystem is co-owned by its most dedicated members. As a **RACE Hero NFT** holder, you are not just a player or a host; you are a stakeholder who earns a share of the revenue from every single table on the protocol, not just your own.
3. **Plug-and-Play Integration**\
   Launching your own room is simple. There is no heavy development lift required. You can configure your games, set up token-gating, and launch on a custom domain in a matter of minutes.

### **üéõÔ∏è Your Creator Toolkit: Full Customization**

As a room operator, you have granular control over every aspect of your games.

* **Game Access Control (Token-Gating):**\
  Choose who gets to play. You can gate entry to your tables based on:
  * **SPL Token Holdings:** Only allow users who hold a specific amount of your community's token.
  * **NFT Ownership:** Restrict access to holders of a specific NFT collection.
  * **Public Access:** Leave your tables open for anyone to join.
* **Custom Currency:**\
  You aren't limited to USDC. Use any SPL token as the primary currency for your cash games and tournament buy-ins. You can even use NFTs for tournament entry!
* **Full Game Customization:**\
  Tailor the poker experience to your community's preferences. You control the variables:
  * Blinds & Stakes
  * Buy-in & Re-buy amounts
  * Late registration periods
  * Knock-Out (KO) & Progressive KO (PKO) bounty structures
* **Flexible Rake Management:**\
  Set your own commission (rake) percentage and cap it based on the big blind. Rake is streamed in **real-time** to your designated wallets as hands are played. You can even split the rake stream across multiple wallets automatically.
* **Prize Pool Sponsorship:**\
  Boost engagement and attract more players by sponsoring your tournaments. You can add guaranteed prize pools using any combination of tokens or NFTs to create massive events.

***

### **üé® Branding & Advanced Features**

Make your poker room a true extension of your brand.

* **White-Label Poker Rooms:**\
  Launch a fully branded poker client on your own domain, complete with your project's logo, colors, and unique identity.
* **Co-Host Mega-Events:**\
  Partner with other DAOs or communities to run high-stakes, cross-promoted tournaments. You can split the rake and management duties seamlessly through the on-chain contract.
* **Custom UX Skins:**\
  Go a step further by skinning the table visuals and tournament lobbies to perfectly match your project‚Äôs aesthetic, creating a deeply immersive brand experience for your players.

***

### **üí∞ Understanding the Revenue Model**

The rake generated from your community's games is split transparently and automatically by the smart contract.

* **1. Your Community's Share (50%):**\
  Half of all the rake generated at your tables is sent **instantly** to the wallet(s) you configured. This is your direct revenue stream. You can view and claim these funds from the "My Room" tab.
* **2. The Ecosystem Share (50%):**\
  The other half is automatically distributed to the rewards pool for all **RACE Hero NFT holders**. This ensures that as your community grows, you are also contributing to and benefiting from the success of the entire RACE Poker and Protocol ecosystem.
