# üõ°Ô∏è Security

Your security is our top priority. On the blockchain, you have unprecedented control over your digital assets. This guide will help you understand that power and use it safely. Please read this section carefully.

***

### üîë **You Are in Control: The Power of a Non-Custodial Wallet**

The single most important security feature of Racepoker is that it is **non-custodial**.

* **What does this mean?** It means that Racepoker **never** holds, controls, or has access to your funds. Your SOL, USDC, and NFTs always remain in your personal wallet, secured by you.
* **How is this different?** On traditional online services or centralized crypto exchanges, when you deposit money, you are trusting that company to keep it safe. On Racepoker, you are not depositing into our account; you are interacting directly with an on-chain smart contract. When you leave a table or win a prize, the funds are sent directly back to your wallet without anyone on our team needing to approve it.

You are your own bank. This gives you incredible freedom and security, but it also comes with the responsibility of safeguarding your assets.

### üö´ **NEVER Share Your Secret Recovery Phrase or Private Key**

If you remember only one thing from this guide, let it be this:

> **NEVER, EVER SHARE YOUR SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE (SEED PHRASE) OR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE, FOR ANY REASON.**

Think of your Secret Recovery Phrase as the master key to your entire digital vault. Anyone who has it can access your wallet and steal all of your funds and NFTs.

You should **NEVER** give this phrase to:

* Anyone claiming to be from the Racepoker team.
* Anyone offering "technical support" in Discord, Telegram, or X (Twitter).
* Any website that prompts you to "validate" or "re-sync" your wallet.
* Any app, form, or person offering a special "airdrop" or "giveaway."

**How to Store Your Seed Phrase Safely:**

* Write it down on paper and store it in a secure, offline location (e.g., a safe).
* Consider making multiple physical copies and storing them in different locations.
* **NEVER** store it in a text file on your computer, in an email, in a cloud drive (like Google Drive or Dropbox), or in a password manager.

WARNING: The Racepoker team, moderators, and support staff will NEVER ask you for your Secret Recovery Phrase or private keys. Anyone who does is a scammer.\

### üïµÔ∏è **How to Identify and Avoid Scams**

The crypto space is a target for scammers. Staying vigilant is your best defense. Here are the most common tactics to watch out for:

* **Unsolicited Direct Messages (DMs):** Scammers will often DM you on Discord or X (Twitter) pretending to be from our team, offering help or a special deal. **We will almost never DM you first.**
* **Impersonation:** Scammers create fake profiles that look identical to our official accounts or team members. Always verify you are interacting with the real account by checking the username and join date.
* **Phishing Websites:** Scammers create fake websites that look exactly like the real Racepoker site to trick you into connecting your wallet and signing a malicious transaction.
* **Fake "Airdrops" or "Mints":** Be wary of surprise links to "claim" free tokens or NFTs. These are almost always scams designed to drain your wallet.

**Your Safety Checklist:**\
‚úÖ **Bookmark the Official Site:** Always navigate to [RACE Poker](https://race.poker/) using your own bookmark rather than clicking on links.\
‚úÖ **Use Official Links:** Only trust links posted in the official announcement channels of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tBGZ4kaQBB) and [X (Twitter) ](https://x.com/RaceGameTeam)accounts.\
‚úÖ **Disable DMs:** In your Discord privacy settings, consider disabling Direct Messages from server members you don't know.\
‚úÖ **Think Before You Click:** If an offer seems too good to be true, it is.

### ‚úÖ **Approving Transactions Safely**

Every action you take on-chain requires you to approve a transaction in your wallet. It's vital to understand what you're signing. When your wallet pops up, take a moment to review the details.

Here‚Äôs what to look for:

1. **The Website Origin (1):** At the top, your wallet will show which website is requesting the transaction. Make sure it says race.poker (or the official URL of the whitelabel you are on). If it's a different URL, **REJECT** the transaction immediately.
2. **The Action (2):** Your wallet will give a simulation or estimate of what will happen. It should clearly state that you are spending a certain amount of tokens (e.g., 10 USDC).
3. **The Gas Fee (3):** This is the small SOL fee required by the network. It should typically be a very small fraction of a SOL (e.g., 0.001 SOL).
4. **The "Approve" Button (4):** Only click this button once you have verified that all the details are correct.

By taking a few seconds to review every transaction, you can protect yourself from malicious sites and keep your funds secure.
