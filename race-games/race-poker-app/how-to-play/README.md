# üé≤ How to Play

Now that you're set up and familiar with the lobby, it's time to dive into the action. RACE Poker offers two primary ways to play: classic Cash Games and exciting Multi-Table Tournaments (MTTs). This section will guide you through both, and then give you a full tour of the gameplay screen.

### üíµ **Cash Games**

Cash games are the classic, "sit down and play" style of poker. You can join or leave at any time, and the chips in front of you have a direct cash value.

1. From the lobby, ensure you have the **"Cash Games"** tab selected.
2. You will see a list of all active tables. You can use the filters at the top of the list to narrow your search, for example, by showing only tables that use USDC or hiding tables that are already full.

Each row in the game list gives you crucial information at a glance:

* **Table Name:** The unique name of the table. (e.g. RICHMOND)
* **Blinds:** Shown as SB / BB (e.g., 0.05 / 0.10 RRR). This indicates the size of the Small Blind and Big Blind, which are forced bets that drive the action, and token used to play. These stakes determine the general size of the game.
* **Buy-in:** Shown as min buy-in (e.g. 5 RRR) and max buy-in (e.g. 50 RRR). This is the minimum and maximum amount of tokens you can bring to the table when you first sit down.
* **Players:** Shows how many players are currently seated out of the maximum allowed (e.g., 4/6).
* **Rake:** A small percentage of the pot taken by the house as a fee for running the game. This is the primary mechanism for funding the platform and rewarding community. You can see the specific rake percentage in the Game Details Panel.

1. **Hover over** any table in the list to see its full details in the side panel.
2. Once you've found a table you like, click the **"Open"** or **"Join"** button.
3. Your wallet will ask you to approve the transaction for your buy-in amount. After you approve, the game table will launch in a new window or tab.
4. To leave a cash game, simply look for the "Cashout" or "Leave Table" button within the game interface. Your remaining chip stack will be sent directly back to your wallet.

### üèÜ **MTT - Multi-Table Tournaments**

Tournaments offer the chance to turn a small entry fee into a massive prize. All players start with the same number of chips, and the blinds increase at regular intervals. The goal is to be the last player standing!

Unlike cash games, your tournament chips have no direct cash value. You play until you either win all the chips or are eliminated. The last remaining players receive a payout from the prize pool based on their finishing rank.

Select the **"Tourneys"** tab in the lobby to see a list of upcoming and ongoing events. You'll see key info like the start time, the entry fee (called a "Ticket"), the number of registered players, and the current prize pool.

Click on a tournament to view its Lobby. Here you'll find all the details:

* **Registering:** If a tournament is open for registration, simply click the **"Register"** button and approve the transaction for the ticket price in your wallet.
* **Late Registration:** Most tournaments have a "late registration" period, usually lasting for the first hour or so. The countdown timer in the tournament lobby will show you exactly how much time is left to join.
* **Re-buys & Add-ons:** Some tournaments may allow you to "re-buy" your stack if you are eliminated during the late registration period. Check the tournament details for specific rules.

The total prize pool is funded by the players' ticket fees. As more players register, the prize pool grows! You can view the full payout structure in the "Prizes" tab of the tournament lobby to see how many places get paid and what each position wins.
