# 🛠️ Create Games

One of the most powerful features of RACE Poker, exclusively available to **RACE Hero NFT holders**, is the ability to create, manage, and host your own on-chain poker games. The **"Create"** tab in the lobby is your all-in-one command center for building your own poker community.&#x20;

***

### 🏦 My Room - **Managing Your Rake**

Before creating a game, you need to designate a "Recipient Account." This is a special on-chain account that automatically collects the rake from any games you create.

* **What it is:** Think of it as your room's treasury. It securely holds the fees generated by your tables.
* **Claiming Funds:** From the "My Room" tab, you can view the balance of your recipient accounts and claim the funds directly to your wallet at any time.
* **Managing Accounts:** You can save multiple recipient addresses, giving you the flexibility to manage rake for different communities or events separately.

### 📈 My Games - **Your Creator Dashboard**

This tab provides a complete list of all the cash tables and tournaments you have created. From here, you can monitor their status, see how many players have joined, and manage your active games.&#x20;

### 🎨 Creating a custom game

This is where you bring your perfect poker game to life.

1. Navigate to the **"Create Tournament"** or **"Create Table"** tab.
2. Fill out the form with your desired parameters, including:
   * **Game Name & Token:** Choose a name for your game and which token to play with (e.g., USDC, RRR, your own community token).
   * **Stakes & Structure:** Set the blinds, buy-in limits, tournament ticket price, and starting chip stacks.
   * **Rules & Settings:** Customize the table size, rake percentage, prize structure (for tournaments), and more.
3. Once you're happy with your settings, click **"Submit"** and approve the transaction to deploy your game's smart contract to the blockchain. Your game will then be visible in the main lobby for players to join!&#x20;

### 💾 Presets - **Save Your Favorite Setups**

If you have a game format you love, you don't have to configure it from scratch every time. The **"My Presets"** tab allows you to save any game configuration. This is perfect for hosting a recurring weekly tournament or a standard cash game for your community. Simply load your preset, make any minor adjustments, and launch.&#x20;

### 🌟 Sponsoring Tournaments

You don't have to be the creator to add excitement to a tournament. The sponsor feature allows anyone to add to a tournament's prize pool.

1. From the main **"Tourneys"** lobby, open the details for any tournament you wish to support.
2. Click the **"Sponsor"** button.
3. Choose the finishing place, the token, and the amount you want to add as a bonus prize.
4. Approve the transaction. Your contribution will be added to the prize pool and automatically paid out to the winner, further boosting community engagement.
