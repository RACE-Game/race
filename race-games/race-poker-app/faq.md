### üí° **General Questions**

**Q: Is it legal to play on RACE Poker in my country?**\
A: RACE Poker operates as a decentralized platform. It is your responsibility to ensure that playing online poker for real money is legal in your local jurisdiction. Due to regulatory considerations, users from the specific countries are restricted from playing: China, Costa Rica, and other nations listed in our [Terms and Conditions](https://race.poker/privacy_policy).

**Q: Is RACE Poker free to play?**\
A: Like all applications on the Solana blockchain, every on-chain action (like placing a bet or joining a table) requires a tiny "gas fee" paid in SOL. These fees are paid to the network, not to RACE Poker, and are typically a very small fraction of a cent. \
Game creators might also charge rake from the cash tables and tournament buy-ins which are taken in the buy-in tokens. These fees are displayed in the game details sections.

**Q: What is a "Poker Room" or "Whitelabel"?**\
A: RACE Poker provides the core technology for multiple themed poker sites. Each site, like Divvy or PALAC3, is a "whitelabel" or "room" with its own branding and community, but they all run on the same secure and transparent RACE Poker engine.

**Q: Can I play on my mobile phone?**\
A: Yes! RACE Poker is designed to be fully functional on modern mobile browsers. For the best experience, we recommend using a mobile-native Solana wallet like Phantom or Solflare. If you have Solana Seeker phone - check the dApp store for RACE Poker and install a mobile app.

### üí≥ **Wallet & Transaction Issues**

**Q: Why do I need a crypto wallet to play?**\
A: A crypto wallet is essential for interacting with any on-chain application. It holds your funds securely and allows you to approve transactions. Because we are non-custodial, your wallet is the only way to manage your funds, ensuring you are always in control. See [Security Section](security.md) for more details.

**Q: My transaction failed. What should I do?**\
A: Transaction failures can happen for a few common reasons:

1. **Insufficient SOL for Gas:** Ensure you have a small amount of SOL in your wallet to cover network fees.
2. **Network Congestion:** The Solana network can sometimes be busy. Wait a few moments and try the transaction again.
3. **Slippage (for Swaps):** If you were using the integrated swap feature, the price may have changed slightly. Try the swap again.\
   If the problem persists, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tBGZ4kaQBB) for support.

**Q: What are gas fees?**\
A: Gas fees are small payments required to perform any transaction on a blockchain network. They compensate the network validators for the computational energy required to process and secure your transaction. On Solana, these fees are typically extremely low.

**Q: I use a wallet for Ethereum/Bitcoin. Can I use that?**\
A: No. RACE Poker is now fully integrated with the Solana blockchain and requires a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom or Solflare). Wallets from other blockchains are not compatible.\
Those will be compatiable as the RACE Protocol integrates the support for other chains.

### üéÆ **Gameplay Questions**

**Q: How long do payouts take after a tournament ends?**\
A: Payouts are instant. The moment a tournament concludes, the smart contract automatically and immediately distributes the prize money to the winners' wallets. There is no waiting period and no manual processing required. This is one of the key advantages of playing on-chain!

**Q: The game table isn't loading or seems stuck. What should I do?**\
A: First, try a simple browser refresh. Since your game state is secured on the blockchain, you will be automatically returned to your seat. If that doesn't work, ensure you have a stable internet connection.

**Q: What happens if I get disconnected during a hand?**\
A: The game has an "away-from-keyboard" (AFK) system. If you disconnect, your hand will be automatically folded when it is your turn to act. You will be sat out of subsequent hands until you return and click the "I'm Back" button. Your chips will remain safely at the table.

**Q: Is the card shuffle really random?**\
A: Yes. The shuffling and dealing process is handled by the [RACE Protocol](broken-reference) using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Unlike traditional sites, this process is transparent and can be publicly verified, guaranteeing a provably fair game. You can contribute to fairness and further decentralize randomization and validation processes by **running your own RACE Protocol Node**.&#x20;

### üñºÔ∏è **NFT & Profile Questions**

**Q: Why do I have to create an on-chain profile?**\
A: Your on-chain profile serves as your unique identity across the entire RACE Poker ecosystem. It links your chosen nickname and PFP to your wallet address, ensuring your reputation and achievements are verifiably yours on the blockchain.

**Q: My NFT isn't showing up as a PFP option. Why not?**\
A: This can happen for a couple of reasons:

* The NFT is in a different wallet than the one you've connected.
* The NFT is not from a collection that is currently supported for PFPs (like RACE Heroes).
* There might be a slight delay in your wallet's data syncing with our platform. Try refreshing the page.

**Q: Do I need a RACE Hero NFT to play on the platform?**\
A: No, you do not need a RACE Hero to play in most of our public cash games and tournaments. However, owning a Hero unlocks significant benefits like rakeback, access to exclusive games, and the ability to [create](create-games.md) your own games.

**Q: Where can I get a RACE Hero NFT?**\
A: You can purchase a RACE Hero on leading Solana NFT marketplaces like [MagicEden](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/race_heroes) and [Tensor](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/raceheroes).\
