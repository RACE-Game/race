# ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started

Getting started on RACE Poker is simple. In just a few minutes, you'll go from setting up your wallet to sitting at your first table. This guide will walk you through every step of the way.

***

### ðŸ‘› **Choosing and Setting Up a Solana Wallet**

Think of a crypto wallet like your digital bank account and ID rolled into one. Itâ€™s a secure application that lets you store your funds, interact with on-chain apps like RACE Poker, and approve transactions. Because RACE Poker is non-custodial, your wallet is the only thing that can access your funds.

It is recommended to use a popular, user-friendly browser extension wallet. Here are top suggestions:

* **Phantom:** [https://phantom.app/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fphantom.app%2F)
* **Solflare:** [https://solflare.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsolflare.com%2F)

**Step-by-step Setup:**

1. Visit the website of your chosen wallet and follow their instructions to add the extension to your browser (e.g., Chrome, Brave, Firefox).
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new wallet.
3.  **CRITICAL STEP:** You will be given a 12 or 24-word **"Secret Recovery Phrase"** (also known as a seed phrase).

    > <mark style="color:$warning;">**WARNING: WRITE THIS PHRASE DOWN AND STORE IT IN A SAFE, OFFLINE LOCATION. NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE. NEVER ENTER IT INTO ANY WEBSITE. ANYONE WITH THIS PHRASE CAN STEAL ALL YOUR FUNDS. THE RACEPOKER TEAM WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR SEED PHRASE.**</mark>
4. Once set up, you'll see the wallet's icon in your browser's toolbar.

### ðŸ”— **Connecting Your Wallet to RACE Poker**

Now that you have a wallet, let's connect it to the platform.

1.  On the RACE Poker homepage, look for the **"Connect Wallet"** button, usually located in the top-right corner of the screen.\

3. Your wallet extension will pop up with a connection request. It's asking for permission to let RACE Poker see your public wallet address. It is **NOT** asking for permission to spend your funds.
4.  Click **"Approve"** or **"Connect"** in the wallet pop-up.\

Success! The "Connect Wallet" button will now be replaced with your wallet address (often shortened, like ABC...XYZ) or a prompt to create a profile.

### ðŸ’° **Funding Your Wallet (SOL & USDC)**

To play, you'll need few types of tokens in your wallet:

* **SOL (Solana):** This is the native token of the Solana blockchain. It's used to pay for "gas fees" â€” tiny transaction costs required for any on-chain action (like placing a bet). You only need a small amount (e.g., 0.1 SOL is enough for hundreds of transactions).
* **USDC:** This is a "stablecoin" pegged to the US Dollar. It is sometimes used as a currency for buy-ins and bets at most of our tables. 1 USDC is always worth approximately $1 USD.
* **RRR** and other tokens: RACE poker app is permissionless and allows anyone to create tournaments and/or cash tables with custom tokens that are used as buy-ins and bets. You can use the integrated jupiter swap widged to get those tokens.

**How to Get Tokens:**

* **Method 1 (Easiest): Use integrate On-Site Swap.** If you already have some SOL, you can use the integrated Jupiter swap widget to easily exchange a small amount of it for USDC directly within the RACE Poker lobby.\

* **Method 2: From an Exchange.** You can buy SOL and USDC on major cryptocurrency exchanges (like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.) and then withdraw them to your personal wallet address. Simply copy your address from your wallet extension and use it as the "destination" or "withdraw" address on the exchange.&#x20;

### ðŸ‘¤ **Creating Your On-Chain Player Profile**

Your on-chain profile is your identity at the poker table. It includes your nickname and your profile picture (PFP). Creating it is a one-time transaction that permanently saves your poker alias to the blockchain.

1.  After connecting your wallet for the first time, you'll see a prompt to **"Create Profile"**. Click it.\

2. A pop-up will appear. Enter your desired **Nickname** in the input field.
3. **Choose your Profile Picture (PFP).** The system will automatically scan your connected wallet for compatible NFTs, including RACE Heroes. Simply click on the NFT you want to use as your avatar. If you don't have one, a default avatar will be used.
4.  Click **"Update Profile"**. Your wallet will pop up asking you to approve a small transaction to save your profile. Confirm it.\

The lobby is your central hub for finding games. Hereâ€™s a quick tour:\

1. **Game Type Tabs (1):** Switch between **Cash Games** and **Tournaments**. This is the main way to filter the kind of poker you want to play.
2. **Game List (2):** The central area where you'll see all available tables or tournaments. Key information like the stakes, number of players, and buy-in is shown here.
3. **Filter Options (3):** Use these toggles to refine the list. You can hide full or empty tables, and filter for games that use a specific token (like USDC or RRR).
4. **Game Details Panel (4):** When you click on a game in the list, this panel on the right will populate with detailed information, including prize structures, blind levels, and more.
5. **Your Profile & Wallet (5):** This section in the top-right shows your connected profile, your SOL and USDC balances, and gives you access to settings and other features.
