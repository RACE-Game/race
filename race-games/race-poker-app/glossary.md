### ‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain & Crypto Terms**

New to crypto? Here are the key concepts that power the security and transparency of Racepoker.

* **Blockchain:** A secure, transparent, and unchangeable public digital ledger that records transactions. Every action on RACE Poker is recorded on the blockchain, making the game provably fair.
* **dApp (Decentralized Application):** An application, like RACE Poker, that runs on a blockchain network instead of a central server owned by a single company.
* **Gas Fee:** A small fee required to conduct a transaction on a blockchain. This fee is paid in the network's native token (SOL on Solana) and compensates the network validators for their work.
* **NFT (Non-Fungible Token):** A unique digital asset that represents ownership of an item on the blockchain. Your RACE Hero is an NFT that acts as both your unique profile picture and your key to unlocking special rewards.
* **Non-Custodial:** A system where you, and only you, have full control over your funds. RACE Poker is non-custodial, meaning we never hold your money. Your assets are always secured in your personal wallet.
* **Secret Recovery Phrase (Seed Phrase):** A 12 or 24-word phrase that acts as the master key to your crypto wallet. **NEVER share this with anyone.** If someone gets your seed phrase, they can steal all your funds.
* **Smart Contract:** A self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs the rules of the game without needing an intermediary. This is what makes RACE Poker's games transparent and fair.
* **Solana:** The high-speed, low-cost blockchain that Racepoker is built on. Its speed allows for a fast and smooth gameplay experience.
* **Stablecoin:** A type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a stable asset, like the US Dollar. **USDC** is a popular stablecoin used on Solana, where 1 USDC is always worth approximately $1 USD.
* **Transaction:** Any action that is recorded on the blockchain, such as creating a profile, joining a table or claiming rewards.
* **Wallet:** A digital wallet (like Phantom or Solflare) used to store your cryptocurrencies and NFTs and interact with dApps like RACE Poker.
* **Wallet Address:** Your public address on the blockchain. It's like your bank account number ‚Äî it's safe to share with others so they can send you funds. This is different from your Secret Recovery Phrase, which must always be kept private.
