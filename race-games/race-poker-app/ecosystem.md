# üåé Ecosystem

RACE Poker is more than just a game ‚Äî it's a community-driven ecosystem built on-chain. Holding Heroes NFTs, participating in games, and contributing to the prize pools are all ways you can get more involved and earn greater rewards.

### ü¶∏ **RACE Heroes NFTs**

Your RACE Hero NFT is your key to unlocking the ultimate Racepoker experience. It's more than just a profile picture; it's a dynamic, on-chain identity that grants you exclusive perks and a stake in the ecosystem.

RACE Heroes is the premier NFT collection on the Solana blockchain. Each Hero is a unique character that serves as your digital alter-ego at the tables. Holding a Hero in your connected wallet automatically upgrades your status and unlocks a suite of benefits.

Being a Hero isn't just about looking good. It comes with tangible advantages:

* **Enhanced Rakeback:** Hero holders receive a significantly higher percentage of the rake they pay back as rewards. The more you play, the more you earn.
* **Exclusive Access:** Get access to special, Hero-only tournaments with unique prize pools and fierce competition.
* **Bonus Rewards:** Qualify for exclusive reward drops and special promotions reserved only for members of the RACE Heroes club.
* **Community Status:** Your Hero is a badge of honor, showing everyone at the table that you're a dedicated member of the Racepoker community.

Show off your Hero at the tables! If you hold a RACE Hero NFT (or any other compatible NFT) in your wallet, you can set it as your in-game avatar.

1. Navigate to your **Player Profile** (the same place you set your nickname).
2. The system will automatically display the compatible NFTs from your wallet.
3.  Simply click on the Hero you want to use and confirm the update. Your new PFP will now be visible to everyone you play against.\

### üéÅ **Rewards and Leveling Up**

We believe in rewarding our players. At Racepoker, every hand you play contributes to your progress and unlocks valuable rewards.

Rake is a small, standard fee (usually a tiny percentage) taken from the pot in cash games or from tournament entry fees. This is how the platform sustains itself and, more importantly, how it funds the rewards ecosystem. A significant portion of all rake collected is funneled directly back to our players through level-up bonuses and rakeback for RACE Hero holders.

Every hand you play in both cash games and tournaments earns you Experience Points (XP). These points accumulate and increase your Player Level. Each new level you achieve unlocks bigger and better rewards.

You can track your progress, see your current level, and view the requirements for the next level in the **"Rewards"** section of the lobby.

As you level up, you'll accumulate a variety of rewards, including **USDC, RRR tokens, tournament tickets, and even special NFTs!**

To claim your earnings:

1. Go to the **"Rewards"** tab in the lobby.
2. Your "Unclaimed Rewards" will be clearly displayed.
3. Click the **"Claim"** button.
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet. The rewards will be sent directly to your wallet instantly.
