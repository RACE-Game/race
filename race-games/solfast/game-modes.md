# ðŸŽ² Game modes

### Classic&#x20;

Welcome to the "Classic Game" mode - this is a true classic for those who love to play big! In this mode, players contribute to a total deposit, which is then raffled off between players at the end of the round.

"Classic Game" allows players to contribute to the common deposit in order to win Sol, which is transferred to the winner at the end of the round. Each bet added to the deposit increases its value.&#x20;

Participants can use their Sol to participate in the game, having one minute until the end of the round. When time expires, all current contributions start participating in the draw.

The higher the value of your contribution, the more chances to win. In case of winning, the winner receives all items from the jackpot.

### Fast&#x20;

Three players is an excellent way to test your luck instantly. In this game mode, only 3 players participate with a maximum prediction limit. The winner receives the deposit from all three participants.

The Fast mode is similar to the Classic mode but with faster games! Games start as soon as the lobby fills with three players. The maximum prediction here is limited to 0.1 Sol.&#x20;

Once the prediction is placed, it cannot be changed.

### Double&#x20;

"Double Game" is a mode where players make predictions on the victory of the black, red, or green sector. Sol is used for predictions in this mode. At the end of the round, the color of the winning sector is determined.

If the result of the draw is the red or black sector, the player receives back twice the amount of their prediction. The green sector increases the winning amount by 14 times.

To play Double Game: Decide on which sector, in your opinion, the roulette wheel will roll - green, red, or black. Wins in red or black sectors double the prediction amount, while wins in green sectors increase the prediction amount by 14 Ñ….

When the round starts, you will have a certain amount of time to make a prediction. Use Sol to predict the victory of your color sector. Wait for the wheel to start spinning after the predictions are closed. The color on which the wheel stops will be the winning one.

### X50&#x20;

The essence of the game is very simple - you need to predict the color and multiplier that you believe will appear in the round.

The coefficient designation corresponds to how much your winnings will increase if you choose it: x2, x3, x5, and x50!

In each separate round, you can simultaneously make predictions for a maximum of 2 different coefficients. The minimum amount to participate in one round is 0.01 SOL , and the maximum is 0.5 SOL.
