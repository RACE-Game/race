# Smart Contract Security

This section assesses the security of the Race Protocol smart contract, focusing on access control, asset management, vulnerability resistance, and the implementation of key features like the mental poker algorithm and recipient accounts. The audit also evaluates the use of best practices and the alignment of functionality with intended behavior.

**Findings:**

**Best Practices:**

* The contract generally follows best practices for smart contract development, such as using established libraries and frameworks.
* However, there are opportunities for further improvement, such as adding more comprehensive unit tests and using formal verification tools to increase confidence in the contract's correctness and security.

**Functionality Alignment:**

* The contract's functionality appears to align with the intended behavior as described in the documentation.
* However, further testing and review are recommended to ensure that all instructions and functions operate as expected under various conditions and edge cases.

**Prioritization:**

* Addressing the critical and high-severity findings should be prioritized due to their potential for financial loss or gameplay disruption.
* The medium and low-severity findings should also be addressed to improve the overall security and clarity of the contract.
