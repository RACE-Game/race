**Medium Priority:**

* **Address Network Delays in Game State Synchronization:**
  * Implement event sequencing or state reconciliation mechanisms to ensure consistent game state updates across different nodes, even in the presence of network delays. This will prevent inconsistencies and potential exploits arising from desynchronized game states.
* **Implement Event Loss Recovery Mechanisms:**
  * Introduce event acknowledgments or state snapshots to detect and recover from lost events during transmission. This will ensure the integrity and consistency of the game state across all participating nodes.

**Low Priority:**

* **Improve Code Clarity and Documentation:**
  * Add detailed comments and explanations within the code to enhance its readability and maintainability.
  * Create comprehensive documentation that clearly explains the design, architecture, and functionalities of the smart contract and other Race Protocol components. This will facilitate understanding and auditing by developers and security experts.
* **Diversify Encryption Methods:**
  * Consider adopting a hybrid approach that combines multiple encryption algorithms for data protection. This will provide defense in depth and mitigate the risk of a single point of failure if a vulnerability is discovered in one of the algorithms.
