# Audit Methodology

This section describes the tools, techniques, and procedures employed during the security audit of Race Protocol. It also outlines the testing coverage and any limitations or assumptions made throughout the audit process.

### **Tools and Techniques:**

The audit utilized a combination of manual code review, automated vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing techniques. Specific tools and techniques included:

**Manual Code Review:**

A thorough review of the smart contract code, WebAssembly game bundles, client-side SDK, and server-side implementations was conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. This involved analyzing the code for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, access control issues, logic errors, and insecure coding practices.

**Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**

Automated vulnerability scanning tools were used to identify known vulnerabilities and common security issues within the codebase. These tools helped to detect potential issues that might be missed during manual review.

**Penetration Testing:**

Penetration testing techniques were employed to simulate real-world attacks and assess the protocol's resilience against malicious actors. This involved attempting to exploit potential vulnerabilities and identifying weaknesses in the system's defenses.

### **Testing Procedures and Coverage:**

The audit followed a structured testing approach, including:

**Unit Testing:**

Individual components of the system, such as smart contract functions and SDK modules, were tested in isolation to verify their functionality and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Integration Testing:**

The interaction between different components, such as the client-side SDK, Transactor server, and blockchain network, was tested to ensure proper communication and functionality.

**Scenario-based Testing:**

Specific game scenarios and potential attack vectors were simulated to assess the protocol's security and fairness under various conditions.

The testing coverage included the core components of Race Protocol:

* Smart contracts
* WebAssembly game bundles
* Race SDK
* Transactor and validator server implementations

### **Limitations and Assumptions:**

The audit was conducted with the following limitations and assumptions:

* **Limited access to internal documentation and design specifications:** The audit primarily relied on publicly available documentation and code comments. Additional insights might be gained with access to internal design documents and specifications.
* **Focus on core components:** The audit primarily focused on the core components of Race Protocol. Additional testing and review might be required for specific game implementations or integrations with external systems.
* **Assumptions about blockchain network security:** The audit assumed the underlying blockchain network is secure and functioning correctly. Vulnerabilities or issues within the blockchain itself were not considered in this audit.

### **Conclusion:**

The audit methodology employed a combination of manual and automated techniques to assess the security of Race Protocol's core components. While some limitations were present, the audit provides a valuable assessment of the protocol's security posture and offers recommendations for further improvement.
