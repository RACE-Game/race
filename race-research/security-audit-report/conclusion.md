# Conclusion

Based on the findings and recommendations outlined in this audit report, Race Protocol demonstrates a promising foundation for building secure and fair web3 games. The core design principles, such as the use of WebAssembly for game logic, P2P randomization, and encrypted communication, contribute to a secure and transparent gaming environment.

However, the audit identified several vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring the security and fairness of games built on Race Protocol.

### **Overall Security Posture:**

* Race Protocol has the potential to be a secure and reliable infrastructure for web3 game development.
* However, addressing the identified vulnerabilities, particularly the critical and high-severity findings, is essential before deploying the protocol in a live environment with real assets at stake.

### **Suitability for Web3 Game Development:**

* Race Protocol offers a promising approach for building web3 games with enhanced security and fairness compared to traditional centralized game architectures.
* However, it is crucial to prioritize and implement the recommended security improvements to ensure the protocol's suitability for real-world use cases involving digital assets and player funds.

### **Recommendations for Future Development:**

* In addition to addressing the specific vulnerabilities identified in this audit, the Race Protocol team should consider the following for future development:
  * **Formal verification of smart contracts and WASM game bundles:** This can provide a higher degree of assurance in the correctness and security of the code.
  * **Implementation of decentralized governance mechanisms:** This would allow the community to participate in decision-making and contribute to the protocol's evolution.
  * **Continuous security audits and assessments:** Regular security audits by independent experts can help identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.

By actively addressing security concerns and implementing best practices, Race Protocol can become a leading infrastructure for building the next generation of secure, fair, and transparent web3 games.
