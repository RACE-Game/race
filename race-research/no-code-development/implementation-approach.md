# Implementation Approach

The addon would be implemented as a JavaScript plugin for Construct 3. It would utilize the [Race JS SDK](../../race-protocol/developer-tools/race-js-sdk/) to interact with Race Protocol games and provide visual scripting blocks and events that map to the SDK's functionalities.

Here's a high-level overview of the implementation steps:

1. **Integrate Race JS SDK:**
   * Include the Race JS SDK as a dependency within the addon.
2. **Develop Visual Scripting Blocks:**
   * Create visual scripting blocks in Construct 3 that correspond to the key functionalities of the Race JS SDK, such as connecting to the Transactor, submitting events, managing player profiles, and accessing game state information.
3. **Handle Events:**
   * Implement event listeners and triggers within the addon to allow Construct 3 games to react to incoming Race events and update the game state and UI accordingly.
4. **Manage Player Profiles:**
   * Integrate the player profile management functions of the Race JS SDK into the addon, allowing players to create and update their profiles directly within the Construct 3 game.
5. **Handle Decryption:**
   * Implement logic within the addon to handle the decryption of hidden knowledge revealed by the game handler, making the information available to the Construct 3 game for display to the player.
6. **Leverage Cross-Platform Capabilities:**
   * Utilize Construct 3's built-in cross-platform deployment features to generate client applications that can run on various platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices, and desktop computers.
   * Solana Mobile Stack support would enable to prepare and publish apks to Solana Saga Dapp Store

### **Benefits and Impact:**

Developing a Construct 3 addon for Race Protocol would offer several benefits:

* **Democratizing Web3 Game Development:** By enabling no-code client application development, the addon would make web3 game creation accessible to a wider audience of game creators, including those without programming experience.
* **Simplified Integration with Race Protocol:** The addon would streamline the integration of Construct 3 games with Race Protocol, allowing game creators to easily leverage the protocol's functionalities and benefits.
* **Cross-Platform Reach:** The addon would enable the creation of cross-platform client applications, expanding the reach of Race games to players on various devices and platforms.
* **Growth of the Race Ecosystem:** By making Race Protocol more accessible to game creators, the addon would contribute to the growth and diversity of the Race ecosystem, fostering innovation and attracting new players and developers.

### **Conclusion:**

Developing a Construct 3 game editor addon for Race Protocol has the potential to significantly simplify and democratize web3 game development. By providing no-code access to the protocol's functionalities and enabling cross-platform deployment, the addon can empower game creators to build engaging and trustworthy web3 games and contribute to the growth of the Race ecosystem.
