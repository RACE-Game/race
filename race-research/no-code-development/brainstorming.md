# Brainstorming

### Introduction

Race Protocol is a multi-chain infrastructure designed to enable the development and deployment of secure and fair web3 games, particularly asymmetric competitive games. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features that ensure transparency, fairness, and extensibility for both game builders and players.

[Construct 3](https://construct.net) is a popular game editor that allows users to create games without writing code. Its visual scripting system and intuitive interface make it accessible to beginners and experienced game creators alike.

By developing a Construct 3 addon for Race Protocol, Race could **bridge the gap between no-code game development and the benefits of web3 gaming.** This would allow Construct 3 users to easily create cross-platform client applications for their Race games, leveraging the security, fairness, and transparency guarantees of the protocol.

### **Addon Functionalities:**

The proposed Construct 3 addon would provide the following functionalities:

* **Race Protocol Integration:**
  * The addon would integrate with the Race JS SDK, allowing Construct 3 games to connect to Race Protocol games and interact with the Transactor/Validator servers.
* **Event Handling:**
  * The addon would provide visual scripting blocks for sending and receiving custom and built-in Race events. This would allow game creators to define player actions, game state updates, and other interactions within the Construct 3 environment.
* **Game State Management:**
  * The addon would provide access to the GameContext object, allowing game creators to retrieve and display game state information in their Construct 3 projects.
* **Player Profile Management:**
  * The addon would allow players to create and manage their Race Protocol profiles directly within the Construct 3 game.
* **Decryption of Hidden Knowledge:**
  * The addon would handle the decryption of hidden knowledge revealed by the game handler, allowing game creators to display the complete game state to players when necessary.
* **Cross-Platform Deployment:**
  * The addon would leverage Construct 3's cross-platform capabilities to enable the creation of client applications that can run on various platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices, and desktop computers.

### **Blockchain-Specific Implementations**:

* **Solana**
  * General **Solana SDK** support
  *   **Solana Mobile Stack** and **Seed Vault** support
