# Private Player Actions

### To do list:

1. **Design the Zero-Knowledge Proof System**:
   1. **Define the statement to be proven**: In this case, the statement is that <mark style="background-color:yellow;">the player's action is valid and allowed according to the current game state and rules</mark>. This may involve proving that the player has the necessary resources or permissions to perform the action, that the action is consistent with the game stage, and that any randomness used is correctly generated and applied.
   2. **Choose a suitable zero-knowledge proof scheme**: The choice of proof scheme will depend on factors like proof size, verification time, and the complexity of the action validation logic.
   3. **Develop the prover and verifier algorithms**: The prover will be implemented in the client application, and the verifier will be implemented in the game handler.
2. **Modify the Client Application**:
   1. **Integrate 01js library**: Add the 01js library to the Race SDK or directly into the client application code.
   2. **Generate the proof of action validity**: When the player takes an action, the client application uses 01js to generate a zero-knowledge proof that the action is valid based on the current game state and rules.
   3. **Send the encrypted action and proof**: The client application sends both the encrypted action data and the zero-knowledge proof to the Transactor server.
3. **Modify the Game Handler (WASM bundle)**:
   1. **Integrate 01js library**: Add the 01js library to the game handler's dependencies.
   2. **Verify the proof of action validity**: When the game handler receives the encrypted action and proof from the Transactor, it uses 01js to verify the proof. If the proof is valid, the game handler decrypts the action data and updates the game state accordingly.

### Benefits:

* **Enhanced Privacy**: Players can keep their actions hidden from other players and the server, allowing for more strategic gameplay and <mark style="background-color:yellow;">bluffing opportunities</mark>.
* **Increased Security**: Encrypting player actions and using zero-knowledge proofs can help prevent cheating or manipulation by malicious actors.
* **More Complex Game Mechanics**: Private actions can enable <mark style="background-color:yellow;">new types of games with more intricate strategic elements and innovative gameplay mechanics</mark>.

### Challenges:

* **Performance Overhead**: The encryption and proof generation processes can add significant computational overhead on the client side, which needs to be carefully managed and optimized.
* **Increased Complexity**: Designing and implementing the zero-knowledge proof system for action validity can be complex and requires expertise in cryptography and game logic.

### Conclusion:

Despite the challenges, integrating 01js and zero-knowledge proofs for private player actions can significantly enhance the privacy and security of Race Protocol games. This approach can open up new possibilities for game mechanics and create a more engaging and trustworthy gaming environment for players.
