# Private Game State Updates

### To do list:

1. **Design the Zero-Knowledge Proof System**:
   1. **Define the statement to be proven**: In this case, the statement is that <mark style="background-color:yellow;">the game state update generated by the game handler is valid and follows the game rules</mark>. This may involve proving that the update is consistent with the previous state, that the player actions are allowed, and that any randomness used is correctly generated and applied.
   2. **Choose a suitable zero-knowledge proof scheme**: As with verifiable randomness, the choice of proof scheme will depend on factors like proof size, verification time, and the complexity of the statement.
   3. **Develop the prover and verifier algorithms**: The prover will be implemented in the game handler, and the verifier will be implemented in the Transactor server.
2. **Modify the Game Handler (WASM bundle)**:
   1. **Integrate 01js library**: Add the 01js library to the game handler's dependencies.
   2. **Encrypt game state updates**: When the game handler generates a state update, it uses 01js to encrypt the update data.
   3. **Generate the proof of update validity**: The game handler uses 01js to generate a zero-knowledge proof that the encrypted update is valid and follows the game rules.
   4. **Send the encrypted update and proof**: The game handler sends both the encrypted state update and the zero-knowledge proof to the Transactor server.
3. **Modify the Servers**:
   1. I**ntegrate 01js library**: Add the 01js library to the Transactor/Validator server's dependencies.
   2. **Verify the proof of update validity**: When the Transactor/Validator receives the encrypted update and proof from the game handler, it uses 01js to verify the proof. If the proof is valid, the Servers accept the update and broadcast it to the clients and other servers.
4. **Modify the Client Applications (Optional)**:
   1. If the client applications need to access or verify the encrypted state updates directly, they will also need to integrate the 01js library and implement the verifier algorithm.

### Benefits:

* **Enhanced Privacy**: Sensitive game state information can be kept private from the Transactor/Validator server, providing stronger privacy guarantees for players.
* **Increased Security**: Encrypting state updates and using zero-knowledge proofs can help mitigate the risk of manipulation or tampering by the Transactor or other entities.
* **More Complex Game Mechanics**: Private state updates can <mark style="background-color:yellow;">enable more complex and innovative game mechanics</mark> that rely on hidden information or secret player actions.

### Challenges:

* **Performance Overhead**: The encryption and proof generation processes can add significant computational overhead, which needs to be carefully managed and optimized.
* **Increased Complexity**: Designing and implementing the zero-knowledge proof system for state update validity can be complex and requires expertise in cryptography and game logic.

### Conclusion:

Despite the challenges, integrating 01js and zero-knowledge proofs for private game state updates can significantly enhance the privacy and security of Race Protocol games. This approach can enable new possibilities for game mechanics and provide a more robust and trustworthy gaming environment for players.
